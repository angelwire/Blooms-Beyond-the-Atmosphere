# Blooms-Beyond-the-Atmosphere
My Collegiate Capstone
These are all the C# scripts from my college capstone game "Blooms Beyond the Atmostphere".  I developed this game with a teammate and we shared programming responsibilities. Some scripts were written exclusively by him, some exclusively by me, but most scripts were handled by both of us.  

I focused mainly on UI programming, and gameplay programming, while my teammate focused on the backend systems.
